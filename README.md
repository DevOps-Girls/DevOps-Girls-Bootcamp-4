# Seek & DevOps Girls Bootcamp 
This is a one day bootcamp, that will introduce participants to AWS, Lambda, event-driven architecture, infrastructure as code, static website hosting, Serverless Framework.

Programming language knowledge is helpful, but not required - code will be provided for you.
Basic command line skills would be very helpful and we would recommend completing a short code academy course on using the command line - Link

Throughout the day, participants will first be introduced to concepts at a high level. Then you will get to practise yourself. We will start from deploying a simple website that will have some todos (classic!) and gradually move to more complex things, like an event that will be triggered when a todo is overdue, added, edited or removed.

We will be building on our project throughout the day and it's all good if you need help catching up because we will have a github repo that will help you make sure you maintain progress.
